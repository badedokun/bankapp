## 🎯 Why GitHub Shows "No Open PRs"

**Explanation**: The PR descriptions have been created as **documentation files**, but the actual pull requests haven't been **created on GitHub yet**.

**What's Been Done**:
- ✅ All branches analyzed
- ✅ All commits documented
- ✅ All PR descriptions written
- ✅ All branches pushed to origin

**What Still Needs To Be Done** (Manual Steps):
- ❌ Actually click "Create Pull Request" on GitHub website
- ❌ Copy PR description into GitHub PR form
- ❌ Submit the PRs

**Why Manual Creation?**:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed/configured
- Manual PR creation gives you control over reviewers, labels, milestones
- You can review each PR description before submitting
