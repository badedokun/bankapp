# iOS Setup Instructions - Quick Start

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Xcode must be installed manually from Mac App Store first!

## üöÄ Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Xcode from Mac App Store (MANUAL - ~1-2 hours)

**You must do this manually:**

1. Open **Mac App Store** app
2. Search for **"Xcode"**
3. Click **"Get"** or **"Install"**
4. Wait for download and installation (~15 GB, 30-60 minutes)

**‚è±Ô∏è Time**: 1-2 hours (mostly download)
**üí∞ Cost**: FREE

---

### Step 2: Run the Automated Setup Script (~15-20 minutes)

After Xcode installation completes, run our automated script:

```bash
# Run the setup script
bash scripts/setup-ios-development.sh
```

**This script will automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Verify Xcode installation
- ‚úÖ Accept Xcode license
- ‚úÖ Set Xcode as active developer directory
- ‚úÖ Install CocoaPods
- ‚úÖ Run `pod install` to setup iOS dependencies
- ‚úÖ Create `OrokiiPayApp.xcworkspace`
- ‚úÖ Verify all installations

**‚è±Ô∏è Time**: 15-20 minutes
**üí∞ Cost**: FREE

---

### Step 3: Build and Run (~5-8 minutes first time)

#### Option A: Build from Terminal (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and run on iPhone 15 Pro simulator
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15 Pro"
```

#### Option B: Build from Xcode

```bash
# Open Xcode workspace
open ios/OrokiiPayApp.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select "OrokiiPayApp" scheme
# 2. Select "iPhone 15 Pro" simulator
# 3. Click Play ‚ñ∂ button (or press Cmd+R)
```

**‚è±Ô∏è First Build**: 5-8 minutes
**‚è±Ô∏è Subsequent Builds**: 1-2 minutes
**üí∞ Cost**: FREE

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Script fails with "Xcode not installed"
**Solution**: Install Xcode from Mac App Store first (Step 1)

### Issue: "sudo: a password is required"
**Solution**: The script will prompt for your Mac password. This is normal and required for:
- Accepting Xcode license
- Installing CocoaPods
- Setting Xcode developer directory

### Issue: "pod install" takes forever
**Solution**: First run can take 10-15 minutes as it downloads all iOS dependencies. Be patient!

### Issue: "Unable to find simulator"
**Solution**: List available simulators:
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available | grep iPhone
```

Then use one of the listed names:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After setup, verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Xcode installed
xcodebuild -version
# Should show: Xcode 15.x or later

# 2. CocoaPods installed
pod --version
# Should show: 1.15.x or later

# 3. Workspace created
ls ios/*.xcworkspace
# Should show: OrokiiPayApp.xcworkspace

# 4. Libraries installed
grep -E "(expo-linear-gradient|blur)" package.json
# Should show both libraries

# 5. Simulators available
xcrun simctl list devices available | grep "iPhone"
# Should show list of iPhone simulators
```
