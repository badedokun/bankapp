**From:** `updated_bankapp_requirements.md` (77KB, 2,333 lines - Legacy PoS Requirements)
**To:** `OrokiiPay_Digital_Banking_Requirements_v2.md` (136KB, 4,680 lines - Digital Banking Requirements)
**Migration Date:** October 8, 2025
**Document Version:** 2.0

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What Changed?

**Product Scope Transformation:**
- ‚ùå **REMOVED:** PoS (Point of Sale) system features (terminals, agents, cash withdrawal)
- ‚úÖ **RETAINED:** 90% of platform infrastructure (multi-tenant architecture, tech stack, security)
- ‚úÖ **ADDED:** Digital banking features (savings, loans, transfers, bill payments, 20 partial features)

**Document Size:**
- Legacy: 77KB, 2,333 lines
- New: 136KB, 4,680 lines
- **Increase:** +76% (primarily new banking features and missing sections)

### Why the Change?

**Product Evolution:**
OrokiiPay started as a PoS agent banking app (Q1 2024) but evolved into a comprehensive digital banking platform (Q2 2025). The legacy requirements document was never updated to reflect this strategic pivot.

**Critical Gap Identified:**
Requirements analysis (October 2025) revealed a 90% misalignment between documented requirements (PoS) and actual product (digital banking). This migration updates the requirements to match current reality.

### 1. PoS Terminal Management
```diff
- ## 4.1 Terminal Management
-
- ### Terminal Registration
- - Agent onboarding with terminal assignment
- - Terminal activation/deactivation
- - Terminal location tracking
- - Terminal inventory management
-
- ### Terminal Operations
- - Cash withdrawal limits per terminal
- - Transaction float management
- - Terminal reconciliation
- - Settlement workflows (agent ‚Üí bank)
```

**Reason for Removal:** OrokiiPay is no longer a PoS system. Digital banking platforms do not require terminal management.

---

### 2. Agent Operations
```diff
- ## 4.2 Agent Operations
-
- ### Agent Roles
- - Super Agent (manages sub-agents)
- - Sub-Agent (operates terminals)
- - Agent performance tracking
-
- ### Agent Workflows
- - Cash withdrawal on behalf of customers
- - Account opening assistance
- - Commission calculation (per transaction)
- - Agent float management
-
- ### Agent Dashboard
- - Daily transaction volume
- - Commission earned
- - Float balance
- - Performance metrics
```

**Reason for Removal:** OrokiiPay serves bank customers directly, not through agent networks.

---

### 3. Cash Withdrawal Services
```diff

-
- ### Commission Structure
- - Customer fee: ‚Ç¶100 per withdrawal
- - Agent commission: ‚Ç¶50 per withdrawal
- - Bank revenue: ‚Ç¶50 per withdrawal
```

**Reason for Removal:** Digital banking platforms provide ATM/branch withdrawals, not agent-based cash withdrawal.

---

### 4. Terminal-Specific UI Components
```diff

```diff
- ## 3.2 User Personas (Legacy)
-
- ### Super Agent
- - Manages network of 10-50 sub-agents
- - Responsible for float management
- - Monitors sub-agent performance
- - Earns override commission
-
- ### Sub-Agent
- - Operates PoS terminal
- - Processes cash withdrawals
- - Earns per-transaction commission
- - Reports to super agent
-
- ### Merchant
- - Accepts payments via PoS terminal
- - Manages inventory
- - Views transaction reports
```

**Reason for Removal:** Replaced with digital banking user personas (Bank Admin, Account Officer, Bank Manager, Customers Tier 1/2/3, Corporate Customers).

## ‚ùì FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q1: Why did we pivot from PoS to Digital Banking?

**A:** OrokiiPay started as a PoS agent banking app in Q1 2024, but market demand and customer feedback led to a strategic pivot toward a comprehensive digital banking platform. By Q4 2024, we had evolved into a multi-tenant SaaS platform serving banks directly, eliminating the need for agent networks. The legacy requirements document was never updated to reflect this change.

---

### Q2: What happens to existing PoS code?

**A:** Based on codebase analysis, OrokiiPay has minimal PoS-specific code remaining. Most PoS features were deprecated during the pivot. The requirements migration formalizes this change.

**Action Required:**
- Audit codebase for any remaining PoS code (terminals, agents, cash withdrawal)
- Remove or archive deprecated code
- Focus all development on digital banking platform

---

### Q3: Will this delay our roadmap?

**A:** No. The new requirements document **aligns** with current development, not redirects it. We are documenting what we're already building (70% complete). The Partial Features Sprint (Weeks 11-16) actually **accelerates** the roadmap by completing critical features needed for Phase 2.

---

### Q4: What about AI features? Are they still in scope?

**A:** Yes, but with **realistic phasing**:
- **Phase 1 (M1-3):** English conversational AI, basic fraud detection - ‚Ç¶30M
- **Phase 2 (M4-6):** Add Nigerian Pidgin support - ‚Ç¶50M
- **Phase 3 (M7-12):** Multi-language NLP (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo) - ‚Ç¶100M (if budget permits)

Total AI budget reduced from ‚Ç¶300M ‚Üí ‚Ç¶180M (40% reduction, more realistic).

---

### Q5: Do we need to re-approve the budget?

**A:** No budget increase required. Total 3-year budget remains ‚Ç¶750M.

**Changes:**
- AI Development: ‚Ç¶300M ‚Üí ‚Ç¶180M (savings: ‚Ç¶120M)
- Partial Features Sprint: ‚Ç¶0 ‚Üí ‚Ç¶12M (new investment)
- Net Savings: ‚Ç¶108M (reallocated to Phase 2-4 features)

---

### Q6: What about existing tenants (e.g., FMFB)?

**A:** **Zero impact.** FMFB is already using OrokiiPay as a digital banking platform (not PoS). The requirements migration formalizes what FMFB is already using.

**FMFB Current Features (All Digital Banking):**
- ‚úÖ Customer accounts (Tier 1/2/3)
- ‚úÖ Internal transfers (FREE)
- ‚úÖ External transfers (NIBSS NIP)
- ‚úÖ Bill payments
- ‚úÖ Savings products
- ‚úÖ Loan products

**No changes to existing functionality.**

---

### Q7: How do we communicate this to stakeholders?
