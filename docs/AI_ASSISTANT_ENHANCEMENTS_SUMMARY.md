## 📝 Code Examples

### Personality Mode Implementation

```typescript
type AIPersonality = 'friendly' | 'professional' | 'playful' | 'roast';

const PERSONALITY_LABELS = {
  friendly: 'Friendly',
  professional: 'Professional',
  playful: 'Playful',
  roast: 'Roast Mode 🔥',
};

const getPersonalityGreeting = (): string => {
  switch (aiPersonality) {
    case 'professional':
      return "Good day. I'm your AI banking assistant. How may I assist you with your financial matters today?";
    case 'playful':
      return "Hey there! 👋 I'm your friendly AI banking buddy! What awesome thing can I help you do today? 🚀";
    case 'roast':
      return "Alright, let's see what kind of financial chaos you've got going on today. What do you need? 🔥";
    default:
      return "Hello! I'm your AI banking assistant. How can I help you today?";
  }
};
```

### Reanimated Animation Example

```typescript
// Shared values
const fadeAnim = useSharedValue(0);
const typingDotsAnim = useSharedValue(0);
const personalityButtonScale = useSharedValue(1);

// Animated styles
const fadeAnimStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  opacity: fadeAnim.value,
}));

// Fade in on mount
useEffect(() => {
  fadeAnim.value = withTiming(1, { duration: 500 });
}, []);

// Repeating animation
useEffect(() => {
  if (isTyping) {
    typingDotsAnim.value = withRepeat(
      withSequence(
        withTiming(1, { duration: 500, easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease) }),
        withTiming(0, { duration: 500, easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease) })
      ),
      -1,
      false
    );
  }
}, [isTyping]);

// Spring animation on button press
const togglePersonalityPicker = () => {
  triggerHaptic('impactLight');
  personalityButtonScale.value = withSequence(
    withSpring(0.9),
    withSpring(1)
  );
  setShowPersonalityPicker(!showPersonalityPicker);
};
```

### Haptic Feedback Example

```typescript
// On message send
const handleSendMessage = async (text: string) => {
  if (!text.trim()) return;

  triggerHaptic('impactMedium'); // Tactile feedback

  // ... send message logic

  try {
    const response = await sendToAIService(text.trim());
    triggerHaptic('notificationSuccess'); // Success feedback
  } catch (error) {
    triggerHaptic('notificationError'); // Error feedback
  }
};
```
