**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ All Tasks Completed Successfully

---

## üéØ Overview

Complete mobile development infrastructure established with comprehensive documentation, library installations, and organized git workflow for both Android and iOS platforms.

---

## ‚úÖ Task 1: Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

### What Was Done
Updated the central project documentation with comprehensive mobile development references.

### Changes Made
- ‚úÖ Added "For Mobile Development (Android & iOS)" section
- ‚úÖ Linked to Android Development Guide
- ‚úÖ Linked to iOS Development Guide
- ‚úÖ Linked to Mobile UI System Compatibility Analysis
- ‚úÖ Linked to iOS Build Requirements Checklist
- ‚úÖ Added complete iOS build commands and testing options
- ‚úÖ Created "Mobile Development (High Priority)" section in priorities

### Files Updated
- `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (committed to both branches)

### Commit
- **Android**: `0674b28` - "docs: update PROJECT_OVERVIEW with mobile development references"
- **iOS**: `01ee209` - "docs: update PROJECT_OVERVIEW with mobile development references"

---

## ‚úÖ Task 2: Start iOS Setup

### What Was Done
Installed critical mobile UI libraries required for implementing World-Class UI Design System on mobile platforms.

### Libraries Installed
1. **expo-linear-gradient@15.0.7**
   - Purpose: Gradient backgrounds (CSS gradients don't work in React Native)
   - Platforms: Both Android and iOS
   - Size: Critical for UI design system compliance

2. **@react-native-community/blur@4.4.1**
   - Purpose: Native blur effects for glassmorphism
   - Platforms: iOS (Android uses opacity fallback)
   - Size: iOS advantage - beautiful native blur support

### Installation Details
```bash
npm install expo-linear-gradient @react-native-community/blur --save --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Note**: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React Native 0.81.1 peer dependency requirements.

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Updated lock file

### Commit
- **iOS**: `3fa7967` - "feat: install mobile UI libraries for iOS development"
- **Android**: `74eb676` - Cherry-picked from iOS branch
