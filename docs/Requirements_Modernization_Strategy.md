# OrokiiPay Requirements Document Modernization Strategy

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Context:** App evolved from PoS system → Digital Banking Platform
**Current Requirements:** Legacy PoS-focused document (outdated)
**Goal:** Modern requirements document reflecting current digital banking reality

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Situation:** OrokiiPay started as a PoS application but has successfully pivoted to a **world-class digital banking platform**. However, the requirements document (`updated_bankapp_requirements.md`) still reflects the legacy PoS system, creating dangerous misalignment between documentation and implementation.

**Risk:** Without updated requirements, future development may:
- ❌ Build wrong features (PoS-focused instead of banking-focused)
- ❌ Miss critical banking requirements
- ❌ Confuse new team members
- ❌ Mislead stakeholders and investors

**Solution:** Systematic requirements document modernization preserving valuable architectural elements while updating product scope to digital banking.

## ✅ WHAT TO KEEP FROM LEGACY REQUIREMENTS

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** (100% - KEEP EVERYTHING)

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT - NO CHANGES NEEDED**

The multi-tenant architecture is **platform-agnostic** and applies equally well to both PoS and digital banking:

```typescript
// These sections are PERFECT - keep as-is:
- Database-per-tenant architecture
- Tenant isolation security measures
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Tenant management service
- Self-service tenant onboarding (adapt to banks, not PoS providers)
- Tenant-specific branding and theming
- Subdomain-based tenant detection
- Platform database + Tenant databases separation
```

**Action:** Copy entire multi-tenant architecture section to new document with minor terminology updates:
- "PoS provider" → "Bank/Financial institution"
- "Agent" → "Customer/Account holder"
- "Terminal" → "Account/Wallet"

### 2. **Technology Stack** (95% - KEEP WITH MINOR UPDATES)

**Status:** ✅ **ALIGNED - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

```typescript
✅ React Native 0.73+ (Current: 0.81.1)
✅ React Native Web
✅ Redux Toolkit + React Query
✅ Node.js 18+ + Express
✅ PostgreSQL 15+
✅ Redis 7+ for caching
✅ JWT authentication
✅ Multi-factor authentication
```

**Action:** Keep technology stack section, update version numbers to current reality.

### 3. **AI Integration Framework** (80% - KEEP STRUCTURE, UPDATE USE CASES)

**Keep:**
- ✅ Conversational AI architecture
- ✅ Multi-language support framework (English, Pidgin, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo)
- ✅ Fraud detection AI

- ❌ "Check agent float balance" → ✅ "Check account balance"
- ❌ "Agent cash-out assistance" → ✅ "Loan application assistance"
- ❌ "PoS terminal troubleshooting" → ✅ "Transaction dispute resolution"

**Action:** Keep AI architecture, rewrite all examples to banking scenarios.

### 4. **Security & Compliance Framework** (90% - KEEP WITH ADDITIONS)

**Status:** ✅ **STRONG FOUNDATION - ENHANCE FOR BANKING**

**Keep:**
- ✅ Zero Trust Architecture
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication

- ✅ NFIU reporting (AML/CFT)
- ✅ IFRS 9 compliance (loan provisioning)
- ✅ Transaction reversal requirements
- ✅ Account lien management
- ✅ Regulatory reporting (CBN, NDIC, NFIU, IFRS)

**Action:** Keep security framework, add comprehensive banking compliance section.

### 5. **Performance Requirements** (95% - KEEP TARGETS)

**Status:** ✅ **VALID FOR BANKING**

```typescript
✅ <500ms API response time
✅ <3 seconds transaction processing
✅ 99.9% uptime SLA
✅ <2 seconds web page load
✅ <3 seconds mobile app start
✅ Offline capability for unreliable networks
```

**Action:** Keep all performance targets - equally important for banking.

### 6. **Deployment & Infrastructure** (100% - KEEP EVERYTHING)

**Status:** ✅ **PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC**

```typescript
✅ Kubernetes orchestration
✅ Multi-tenant CI/CD pipeline
✅ Per-tenant database backups
✅ Auto-scaling infrastructure
✅ Disaster recovery procedures
✅ Blue-green deployments
```

**Action:** Keep entire deployment section as-is.
