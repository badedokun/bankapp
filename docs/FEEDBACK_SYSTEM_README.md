## 🎨 Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Be specific** - "Login button doesn't work" vs "App crashed when I tapped Login on iOS"
2. **Include steps** - Tell us how to reproduce the issue
3. **Attach screenshots** - A picture is worth 1000 words
4. **One issue per row** - Don't combine multiple issues
5. **Update if resolved** - Let us know if a later build fixed it

### For Product Team:
1. **Review daily** - Don't let feedback pile up
2. **Respond quickly** - Acknowledge within 24 hours
3. **Set clear priorities** - Use the priority scoring system
4. **Track trends** - Look for patterns in feedback
5. **Close the loop** - Update users when issues are fixed
