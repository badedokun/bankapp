# Conversational Transfer Flow - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Implemented a complete step-by-step conversational transfer flow in the AI chat. Users can now complete entire transfers through natural conversation without leaving the chat interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Conversation State Management**
- Tracks multi-step conversations across messages
- 5-minute timeout for abandoned conversations
- Supports multiple concurrent users
- Automatic cleanup of expired states

### 2. **6-Step Transfer Flow**

**Step 1: Amount**
```
AI: "How much would you like to send?"
User: "5000" or "â‚¦5,000"
Validates: Amount > 0 and â‰¤ â‚¦10,000,000
```

**Step 2: Account Number**
```
AI: "Please enter the recipient's account number (10 digits):"
User: "0123456789"
Validates: Exactly 10 digits
```

**Step 3: Bank Selection**
```
AI: "Which bank is the recipient's account with?"
Suggestions: Access Bank, GTBank, Zenith Bank, etc.
User: "GTBank" or "Access Bank"
Validates: Bank exists in Nigerian banks list
```

**Step 4: Account Verification**
```
AI: "Verifying account details..."
AI: "âœ… Account verified!
     Recipient: John Doe
     Account: 0123456789
     Bank: GTBank
     Amount: â‚¦5,000"
```

**Step 5: Description (Optional)**
```
AI: "Would you like to add a description? (Optional - press Enter to skip)"
User: "Payment for services" or "Skip"
```

**Step 6: PIN Verification**
```
AI: "Please enter your 4-digit transaction PIN to complete the transfer:"
User: "1234"
Validates: Exactly 4 digits
Verifies: Against hashed PIN in database
```

**Completion**
```
AI: "âœ… Transfer Successful!
     Amount: â‚¦5,000
     Recipient: John Doe
     Account: 0123456789
     Bank: GTBank
     Reference: ORP_1760380123456_ABC123

     Your transfer has been processed successfully!"
```

### 3. **Smart Features**

## Technical Architecture

### Files Created

**1. ConversationStateManager.ts**
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  userId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  currentFlow?: 'transfer' | 'bill_payment' | null;
  step: number;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

// Singleton with automatic cleanup every 60 seconds
```

**2. ConversationalTransferService.ts**
```typescript
export class ConversationalTransferService {
  // 6-step transfer flow with validation
  private static readonly TRANSFER_STEPS: TransferStep[]

  // 16 Nigerian banks supported
  private static readonly NIGERIAN_BANKS

  // Main conversation processor
  static async processTransferConversation(
    message: string,
    userId: string,
    conversationId: string
  ): Promise<ConversationalResponse>

  // Transfer execution
  private static async executeTransfer(...)

  // PIN verification
  private static async verifyPIN(userId: string, pin: string)

  // Balance check
  private static async checkBalance(userId: string, amount: number)

  // Create transfer record
  private static async createTransfer(userId: string, data: any)
}
```

### Files Modified

**server/routes/ai-chat.ts**
- Added conversation state check
- Routes transfer intents to conversational flow
- Maintains conversation context across messages
- Returns `inConversation` flag to frontend

### Database Integration

**Transfer Record Created:**
```sql
INSERT INTO tenant.transfers (
  sender_id, tenant_id, reference, amount, fee, description,
  source_account_number, source_bank_code,
  recipient_account_number, recipient_bank_code, recipient_name,
  status, metadata
) VALUES (...)
```

**Wallet Debited:**
```sql
UPDATE tenant.wallets
SET balance = balance - $1, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = $2 AND wallet_type = 'primary'
```

**Transaction Synced:**
- Trigger automatically creates transaction record
- Status set to 'completed' (from previous fix)
- AI-initiated flag set in metadata

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complete Transfer
```
User: "Transfer money"
AI: "Great! Let's start your transfer. How much would you like to send?"

User: "5000"
AI: "Please enter the recipient's account number (10 digits):"

User: "0123456789"
AI: "Which bank is the recipient's account with?"
Suggestions: [Access Bank, GTBank, Zenith Bank, ...]

User: "GTBank"
AI: "âœ… Account verified!
     Recipient: John Doe
     Account: 0123456789
     Bank: GTBank
     Amount: â‚¦5,000

     Would you like to add a description? (Optional)"

User: "Skip"
AI: "Please enter your 4-digit transaction PIN:"

User: "1234"
AI: "âœ… Transfer Successful!
     Amount: â‚¦5,000
     Recipient: John Doe
     Reference: ORP_1760380123456_ABC123"
```

### Example 2: With Errors
```
User: "Send money"
AI: "How much would you like to send?"

User: "abc"
AI: "Please enter a valid amount (e.g., 5000 or â‚¦5,000)

     How much would you like to send?"

User: "5000"
AI: "Please enter the recipient's account number (10 digits):"

User: "123"
AI: "Please enter a valid 10-digit account number

     Please enter the recipient's account number (10 digits):"
```

### Example 3: Cancellation
```
User: "Transfer money"
AI: "How much would you like to send?"

User: "cancel"
AI: "Transfer cancelled. How else can I help you?"
Suggestions: [Check balance, View transactions, Start new transfer]
```

## Security Features

âœ… **PIN Verification**: Bcrypt hash comparison
âœ… **Balance Check**: Verifies funds before transfer
âœ… **Transaction Limits**: Max â‚¦10,000,000 per transfer
âœ… **Audit Trail**: All transfers logged with AI metadata
âœ… **Session Timeout**: 5-minute conversation timeout
âœ… **No PIN Storage**: PIN never stored in conversation state

## Frontend Integration

The AI response includes:

```json
{
  "response": "Please enter your 4-digit transaction PIN:",
  "suggestions": ["Cancel transfer"],
  "inConversation": true,
  "completed": false,
  "metadata": {
    "source": "conversational_transfer",
    "conversationId": "conv_1760380123456",
    "step": 6
  }
}
```

Frontend should:
1. Check `inConversation` flag
2. Display conversation UI (hide other suggestions)
3. Pass `conversationId` in context for subsequent messages
4. Show `completed` screen when transfer succeeds

## Voice Support

Works seamlessly with voice:
1. Voice-to-text: "Transfer five thousand naira"
2. AI responds with next question
3. Voice input: "Zero one two three four five six seven eight nine"
4. Continue flow until completion

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Successful Transfer
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/ai/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: fmfb" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Transfer money",
    "context": {"page": "chat", "conversationId": "test123"}
  }'
```

### Test Case 2: Invalid Amount
```bash
# Step 1
{"message": "Transfer money", "context": {...}}
# Response: "How much would you like to send?"

# Step 2
{"message": "abc", "context": {"conversationId": "test123"}}
# Response: "Please enter a valid amount..."
```

### Test Case 3: Cancellation
```bash
# Mid-flow
{"message": "cancel", "context": {"conversationId": "test123"}}
# Response: "Transfer cancelled..."
# State cleared
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **NIBSS Name Enquiry Integration**
   - Real account name lookup
   - Currently returns simulated name

2. **Saved Beneficiaries**
   - "Transfer to John" â†’ Finds saved John in beneficiaries
   - No need to enter account number

3. **Transfer Templates**
   - "Pay electricity bill" â†’ Pre-filled amount and recipient
   - Recurring transfers

4. **Multi-language Support**
   - Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa conversation flows
   - Already supports Nigerian terms

5. **Scheduled Transfers**
   - "Transfer â‚¦5,000 every Friday"
   - Set up recurring transfers via chat

## Known Limitations

1. **Account Name Lookup**: Currently simulated (needs NIBSS integration)
2. **Bank Code Validation**: Uses predefined list (should query live bank list)
3. **Fee Calculation**: Hardcoded to 0 (should use fee calculation service)
4. **Transaction Receipt**: Not generated (should create PDF receipt)

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- Uses existing tables (transfers, transactions, wallets)
- Backward compatible (old transfer flow still works)
- No frontend changes required (works with current chat UI)

## Monitoring

Conversation states logged:
```
console.log('ðŸ’¬ Starting new transfer conversation flow')
console.log('ðŸ’¬ Continuing transfer conversation flow')
```

Transfer completion logged:
```
console.log('âœ… Transfer completed via conversational flow')
```
