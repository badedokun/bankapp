## ❌ CRITICAL GAPS

### 1. **Product Mismatch** (🔴 URGENT)

**Document Says:**
- "Nigerian PoS Mobile App"
- Target: PoS agents, merchants
- Features: Cash withdrawal, agent operations, terminal management

**OrokiiPay Reality:**
- Digital banking platform
- Target: Bank customers
- Features: Savings, loans, transfers, bill payments

**Action Required:** Executive decision needed (Week 1)

### 2. **AI Over-Scoped** (🔴 HIGH RISK)

**Document Promises:**
- Nigerian language NLP (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo)
- Voice biometrics
- Document OCR
- **Cost: ₦300M initial + ₦255M/year**

**Reality:**
- Nigerian language NLP: Extremely complex, 12-18 months
- Voice biometrics: ₦50M+ licensing
- OCR: 6-12 months custom development

**Recommendation:** Phase AI features realistically
- Phase 1: English AI only (₦30M)
- Phase 2: Add Pidgin (₦50M)
- Phase 3: Full multi-language (₦100M)

### 3. **Missing Critical Sections**

- ❌ Testing strategy (OrokiiPay has 4-layer framework, not documented)
- ❌ Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- ❌ Data migration procedures
- ❌ Operational runbooks
- ❌ Detailed compliance requirements (CBN, NDPR, PCI DSS)
