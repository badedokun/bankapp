## üéØ Merge Strategy

### Option 1: Sequential Merging (Recommended)
Merge branches one at a time to avoid conflicts:

1. Merge `enhanced-ai-assistant` first (TypeScript fixes)
2. Merge `mobile-ios-build` second (database migrations)
3. Merge `mobile-android-build` third (parallel to iOS)
4. Merge `transfer-transactions-mgmt` last (builds on migrations)

### Option 2: Parallel PRs
Create all PRs simultaneously and merge when approved:
- Faster overall timeline
- Risk of merge conflicts
- Requires coordination between reviewers

### Option 3: Batch Merging
Group related branches:
- Batch 1: TypeScript + AI (enhanced-ai-assistant)
- Batch 2: Mobile (ios-build + android-build)
- Batch 3: Features (transfer-transactions-mgmt)
