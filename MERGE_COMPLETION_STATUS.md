## 🎯 Recommended Merge Order

To avoid conflicts, merge in this order:

1. **enhanced-ai-assistant** (TypeScript fixes - foundation)
2. **transfer-transactions-mgmt** (Database migration - foundation)
3. **mobile-ios-build** (Depends on database migration)
4. **mobile-android-build** (Parallel to iOS, depends on database migration)

**Rationale**:
- TypeScript fixes should go first (affects build)
- Database migrations should go before features that use them
- Mobile branches can go in parallel or sequence (no conflicts)
