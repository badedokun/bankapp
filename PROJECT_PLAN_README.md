## üöÄ How to Use in Excel

### **Step 1: Import CSV Files**

1. Open Microsoft Excel
2. Go to **Data** > **Get Data** > **From Text/CSV**
3. Select `OrokiiPay_Project_Plan.csv`
4. Click **Load**
5. Repeat for the other two CSV files

### **Step 2: Create Workbook Structure**

Create a multi-sheet workbook with tabs:
- **Dashboard** (from OrokiiPay_Project_Dashboard.csv)
- **Project Plan** (from OrokiiPay_Project_Plan.csv)
- **Timeline** (from OrokiiPay_Timeline_Gantt.csv)

### **Step 3: Format Dashboard Sheet**

1. **Split into sections:**
   - Use Excel's "Text to Columns" if sections merged
   - Add borders between sections
   - Color-code headers (dark blue background, white text)

2. **Add conditional formatting:**
   ```
   % Complete:
   - 0-25% = Red
   - 26-50% = Orange
   - 51-75% = Yellow
   - 76-100% = Green

   Priority Level:
   - Critical = Red
   - High = Orange
   - Medium = Yellow
   - Low = Green

   Status:
   - Complete = Green
   - In Progress = Yellow
   - Not Started = Red
   ```

3. **Create charts:**
   - Pie chart for Priority Breakdown
   - Bar chart for Component Completion
   - Stacked bar for Phase Completion
   - Timeline for Milestone Timeline

### **Step 4: Format Project Plan Sheet**

1. **Freeze header row:**
   - Select row 2
   - View > Freeze Panes > Freeze Top Row

2. **Add filters:**
   - Select header row
   - Data > Filter

3. **Apply conditional formatting:**
   - % Complete: Color scale (Red ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green)
   - Priority: Icon sets (Red/Yellow/Green flags)
   - Status: Color cells (Red/Yellow/Green)

4. **Create pivot tables:**
   - By Phase and Status
   - By Owner and Priority
   - By Week and Status

### **Step 5: Format Timeline Sheet**

1. **Apply Gantt chart formatting:**
   - Select data range (Week columns)
   - Replace ‚ñ† with colored cells:
     - Completed work: Dark green
     - Planned work: Light blue
     - Critical path: Red
     - Milestones: Yellow star

2. **Conditional formatting for visual Gantt:**
   ```
   Rule: If cell = "‚ñ†"
   Format: Blue fill, white text

   Rule: If cell contains "COMPLETED"
   Format: Dark green fill

   Rule: If cell contains "Critical Path"
   Format: Red fill
   ```

3. **Add timeline header:**
   - Merge cells for month groupings
   - Add "Today" indicator column

### **Step 6: Advanced Excel Features**

#### **Create Dynamic Dashboard**
```excel
1. Insert slicers for filtering:
   - Phase slicer
   - Priority slicer
   - Owner slicer
   - Status slicer

2. Link slicers to pivot tables and charts

3. Add KPI cards using formulas:
   =COUNTIF(Status,"Complete")/COUNTA(Status)  // Completion %
   =SUMIF(Priority,"Critical",1)                // Critical task count
   =MAX(End Week)                               // Project end date
```

#### **Add Formulas**
```excel
// Auto-calculate % complete by phase
=COUNTIFS(Phase,A2,Status,"Complete")/COUNTIF(Phase,A2)

// Calculate resource needs
=SUMIFS(Duration,Owner,"Backend Team",Status,"Not Started")

// Identify overdue tasks
=IF(End_Week<WEEKNUM(TODAY()),AND(Status<>"Complete"),"OVERDUE","")

// Calculate critical path
=IF(Dependencies<>"","Yes","No")
```

#### **Create Charts**

1. **Phase Progress Chart (Stacked Bar)**
   - X-axis: Phase names
   - Y-axis: Task count
   - Series: Complete, In Progress, Not Started

2. **Burndown Chart**
   - X-axis: Week number
   - Y-axis: Remaining tasks
   - Line: Planned vs Actual

3. **Resource Allocation (Stacked Area)**
   - X-axis: Weeks
   - Y-axis: FTE count
   - Series: Backend, Frontend, Security, etc.

4. **Risk Matrix (Scatter)**
   - X-axis: Impact
   - Y-axis: Probability
   - Bubbles: Risks sized by severity
