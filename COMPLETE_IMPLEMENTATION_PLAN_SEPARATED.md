## üìä **RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Development Team Structure:**

#### **Platform Admin Team (Weeks 1-8):**
- **1 Senior Backend Developer** - Platform services and security
- **1 Senior Frontend Developer** - Platform admin interface
- **1 DevOps Engineer** - Separate deployment and security
- **1 Security Specialist** - Access control and audit

- **Monitoring and audit systems** (platform vs tenant separation)
- **Database access controls** (platform vs tenant permissions)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Non-Negotiable Requirements:**

1. **COMPLETE SEPARATION:** Platform admin and tenant banking must be completely separate applications, databases, and domains. No shared components or access.

2. **SECURITY FIRST:** Platform admin requires enhanced security (MFA, IP restrictions, comprehensive audit). Tenant banking uses standard banking security.

3. **ZERO ACCESS OVERLAP:** Tenant admins cannot see platform data. Platform admins have read-only support access to tenant data.

4. **PROPER SAAS ARCHITECTURE:** This follows standard SaaS best practices. Mixing would violate security standards and prevent enterprise adoption.

### **Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Platform Admin System FIRST** (Weeks 1-6) - Business operations foundation
2. **Enhanced Tenant Features** (Weeks 7-8) - Improve bank experience
3. **Complete Banking Features** (Weeks 9-20) - Market completeness

### **Success Dependencies:**
- **Week 1:** Start platform admin application (separate codebase)
- **Week 2:** Implement proper security separation
- **Week 4:** Validate complete access separation
- **Week 6:** Deploy platform admin to production
- **Week 8:** Onboard first new bank tenant via platform admin
